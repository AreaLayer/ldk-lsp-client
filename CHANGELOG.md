# 0.1.0-alpha - Feb. 15, 2024
This is the first alpha release of `lightning-liquidity`. It features
early-stage client- and service-side support for the LSPS2 just-in-time (JIT)
channel protocol.

**Note:** This release is still considered experimental, should not be run in
production, and no compatibility guarantees are given until the release of 0.1.
